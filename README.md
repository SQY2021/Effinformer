This is a GitHub repository for the project "[Effinformer: A Deep Learning-Based Data-Driven Modeling of DC-DC Bidirectional Converters](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10285031)". [DOI: 10.1109/TIM.2023.3318701](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10285031).Published in: [IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement]([https://](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=19)). The project aims to develop a data-driven model for a DC-DC bidirectional converter using an efficient self-attention network (Effinformer).

We design a practical end-to-end DL framework named efficient Informer ([Effinformer](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10285031)), which leverages a sparse self-attention mechanism to reduce the computational cost of the network while improving accuracy and efficiency significantly. Specifically, the distilling blocks based on dilated causal convolutional layers are constructed to obtain a larger receptive field and extract long-term historical information. To mine potential trend features and expedite computation, we suggest an alternative approach that replaces the original multi-head attention in the decoder of Informer. Finally, an appropriate gated linear unit (GLU) is chosen to improve prediction accuracy.

# Procedure to run this code
- Click on code and download zip
- Upload the file on your google drive
- Open the file with zip extractor in the drive
- You can click open the file in [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com) and run the file only after the file is mounted in your drive
- All changes to the Prediction Length, epochs, dataset, etc can be made in the [Effinformer.py](https://github.com/SQY2021/Effinformer/) file
- You may make changes in the data set used and target to be run

# A Simple Example
To demonstrate the model's prediction process, we utilize a subset of our data set consisting of 20,000 sampling points. This smaller-scale data set will allow us to effectively showcase the model's capabilities. See [Predict.ipynb](https://github.com/SQY2021/Effinformer/blob/main/Predict.ipynb) for workflow.
